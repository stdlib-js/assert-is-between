    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

# isBetween

> Test if a value is between two values.



<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import isBetween from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/assert-is-between@deno/mod.js';
```
The previous example will load the latest bundled code from the deno branch. Alternatively, you may load a specific version by loading the file from one of the [tagged bundles](https://github.com/stdlib-js/assert-is-between/tags). For example,

```javascript
import isBetween from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/assert-is-between@v0.2.3-deno/mod.js';
```

#### isBetween( value, a, b\[, left, right] )

Tests if a `value` is between two values `a` (left comparison value) and `b` (right comparison value).

```javascript
var bool = isBetween( 4, 3, 5 );
// returns true

bool = isBetween( 2, 3, 5 );
// returns false

bool = isBetween( 6, 3, 5 );
// returns false
```

By default, the function assumes that `a` and `b` are inclusive.

```javascript
var bool = isBetween( 3, 3, 5 );
// returns true

bool = isBetween( 3, 3, 5, 'closed', 'closed' );
// returns true

bool = isBetween( 5, 3, 5 );
// returns true

bool = isBetween( 5, 3, 5, 'closed', 'closed' );
// returns true
```

To make `a` and/or `b` exclusive, set the respective arguments to `'open'`.

```javascript
var bool = isBetween( 3, 3, 5, 'open', 'closed' );
// returns false

bool = isBetween( 5, 3, 5, 'closed', 'open' );
// returns false
```

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   If `a` and `b` are inclusive, the comparison is equivalent to

    ```text
    a <= v <= b
    ```

-   If `a` is exclusive and `b` is inclusive, the comparison is equivalent to

    ```text
    a < v <= b
    ```

-   If `a` is inclusive and `b` is exclusive, the comparison is equivalent to

    ```text
    a <= v < b
    ```

-   If `a` and `b` are exclusive, the comparison is equivalent to

    ```text
    a < v < b
    ```

-   If provided non-numeric values, comparisons are performed according to lexicographic order.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
import randu from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/random-base-randu@deno/mod.js';
import round from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-base-special-round@deno/mod.js';
import isBetween from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/assert-is-between@deno/mod.js';

var bool;
var a;
var b;
var v;
var i;

for ( i = 0; i < 100; i++ ) {
    a = round( (randu()*10.0) + 5.0 );
    b = round( (randu()*10.0) + 15.0 );
    v = round( randu()*25.0 );
    bool = isBetween( v, a, b, 'open', 'closed' );
    console.log( '%d < %d <= %d: %s', a, v, b, bool.toString() );
}
